# Grievance-Handling-System

Developed a Grievance Handling System using Python's Tkinter GUI library, allowing users to submit complaints or feedback with their name, gender, and comment details.
Integrated the application with a database using SQLite3 for efficient data storage and the DBConnect module, enabling secure storage and retrieval of user-submitted grievances or complaints.
Implemented functionality to display a list of previously submitted complaints using the ListComp module, providing an efficient way to review and manage grievances/complaints.
